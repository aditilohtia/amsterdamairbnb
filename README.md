#  Amsterdam Airbnb Price Predictor

Problem Statement:
Listing a property on Airbnb can be challenging for new renters, who must determine a fair nightly rate. Incorrect pricing can lead to lost revenue or missed bookings. Our project aims to address this by predicting optimal rental prices based on property characteristics.

Solution:
Our team will develop a machine learning model to predict Airbnb rental prices. We will start by cleaning and analyzing data from online sources to uncover patterns that impact pricing. Using these insights, we'll train a linear regression model to make accurate pricing predictions. The final model will be user-friendly, providing clear recommendations to alleviate the stress of pricing for new Airbnb renters.

Data Source:
We obtained a dataset from Kaggle, featuring 33 columns and 7,834 rows of data on Amsterdam Airbnb listings. Key columns include host information, property details, and pricing.

Process:

Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset for analysis by removing inconsistencies and ensuring data quality.
Feature Analysis: Identify which property features most significantly affect nightly rates.
Model Implementation: Develop and train a linear regression model to predict prices.
User Interface: Ensure the model's output is easy to understand and apply for new Airbnb hosts.
Goal:
Our goal is to provide an accurate, easy-to-use tool that helps new Airbnb hosts set competitive and fair rental prices, reducing the guesswork and associated stress.
